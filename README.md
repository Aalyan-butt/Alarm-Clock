# Alarm Clock

An interactive Python-based alarm clock application that helps you wake up at your desired time by playing a random YouTube video as your alarm. The project demonstrates the use of Python libraries like `time`, `webbrowser`, `os`, and `random`.

## Features
- Set an alarm time in 24-hour format (e.g., `20:30`).
- Automatically plays a random YouTube video from a predefined list when the alarm triggers.
- Creates a `YT.txt` file to store YouTube links if it doesn't already exist.
